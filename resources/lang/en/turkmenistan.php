    "popup_p" => "The sun rises over a country once in the hands of the Persian empire, conquered by Alexander the Great, and sitting on the Silk Road. <br />
With its millennial history, nomadic culture and cities of the desert, it has as much to offer as any of its neighboring countries of central Asia. <br /><br />

Being little exposed to tourism, Turkmenistan is remaining a mysterious place which will grant a lot to any visitor willing to discover its heritage. <br />
It has amazing landscapes, oases, ancient and modern cities, and incredible archaeological sites. <br /><br />

Ashgabat, “the city of love”, is full of flowering parks, architectural masterpieces, sculptures, fountains, monuments and museums holding treasures from the Turkmen and Soviet times. <br /><br />

Its modern style comes from its reconstruction following the 1948 earthquake.
Since then, the capital has adorned itself with white marble buildings, tall residential towers and unusual monuments:  The top of  the Arch of Neutrality is covered with a golden statue of Turkmenbashi, and the presidential palace located in the Independence Square shines with a golden dome. Among the many mosques, the Azadi (or Ertugrul Gazi) is worth a visit.  <br /><br />

On Sundays, the Tolkuchka bazaar is a great place to hunt for special souvenirs from all the regions. <br /><br />

Turkmenistan is famous for its carpets. Ashgabat’s impressive collection includes pieces from the 17<sup>th</sup> century, including the largest carpet in the world, nearly 400 sqm. and weighing over a ton. <br /><br />

The National Museum of History and Ethnography is as interesting. It holds a splendid collection of ancient coins collected throughout the whole country, as well as remains from the Old Nissa city. <br /><br />

Nissa is close to Achgabad. Ancient capital of the Parthian empire (2<sup>nd</sup> century B.C), its fortress is listed a UNESCO World Heritage. A truly splendid gem, it attracts worldwide archeologists and historians. 

Gonur-Dépé, the legendary Margush capital, is one of the most famous sites from the Bronze Age (2300-1600 BC). It shelters ruins of fortresses and temples, as well as a necropolis from the 3<sup>rd</sup> millennium B.C. <br /><br />

Merv, the oldest city on the Silk Road, is a dream place for ancient cultures and civilizations fans. Listed a UNESCO World Heritage site, it has been the home to five different antique cities. Its most majestic monument is Sultan Sandjar’s  mausoleum which  has an a very nice legend attached to its origin. <br />
The Abdullahan-Kala fortress, formerly surrounded with huge moats, is one of a kind. <br /><br /> 

Another UNESCO World Heritage jewel is Kunya-Urguentch, a capital city in the times of  Shah Kharezm's empire. <br />
The 15<sup>th</sup> century Turabeg-khanum mausoleum, the 11-14<sup>th</sup> century Kutlug Timur minaret - its 60 m make it the highest of all medieval minarets in central Asia, and the Arslan mausoleum- the founder of the Kharezm pre-Mongol empire, are among its gems. <br /><br />



The Karakum desert (“black sands”) covers over half of the country. It is characterized by “takyrs”, large ditches surrounded by sand dunes. <br /><br />
 
Once the home of a bronze age civilization in the 3<sup>rd</sup> millennium B.C, it is still to this day inhabited by Tekes, a tribe who has been raising the Akhal-Tekes renowned horse breed for over 3000 years. <br /><br />


Despite the desert’s harsh weather conditions, oases cities such as Tejen could still bloom. <br />
The Karakum desert soil is also full of natural gas. Its famous Darvaza crater, nicknamed “Door to Hell” appeared following an incident during a drilling in 1971. Its gas has been continuously burning since, creating a spectacular scenery. <br /><br />
